I have a passion for numbers, which is why I am dedicated to pursuing a career in actuarial science. My academic background has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex problems and analyze data effectively, while my professional experience has helped me learn how to apply some of those skills to the real-world. I’m particularly interested in exploring how my education can be applied to the stock market. Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading finance books, cooking, and crocheting."
