Welcome to my website! I'm using this platform to share my experiences and insights. This website is a space where I currently share a little bit about myself and my experiences (in the CV). But I soon plan on sharing a variety of topics that interest me and the new things I learn in my academic journey as a statistics student.

So whether you're here to read more into student life, explore different ideas, or simply curious about what I have to share, I hope you find this website engaging and thought-provoking.

Feel free to reach out to me through the e-mail in my CV (shahjenad\@gmail.com).

Thank you for visiting!
